# FileSync

I needed to update the hosts file that is used for local DNS.<br/>
Instead of locating hosts file every time and editing it, <br/>
I made an application that helps 
  * to insert the text entered in input into the database
  * updates the hosts file.
  * adds or removes the text from hosts file.

Front end was done in react js.<br/>
Backend was done in node js.
